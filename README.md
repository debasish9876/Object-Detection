Object Detection using TensorFlow
Welcome to the Object Detection using TensorFlow project! This powerful tool harnesses the capabilities of TensorFlow to build a robust and accurate object detection system. Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance and autonomous vehicles to augmented reality and retail analytics. This project is designed to be versatile and customizable, featuring real-time object detection, pre-trained models for quick deployment, and the flexibility to train the model with your own dataset for detecting custom objects.

To get started, ensure you have Python 3.6+, TensorFlow 2.x, and other required libraries listed in requirements.txt. Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies. Configure the system by updating config.json with your model and dataset paths. You can run the object detection by initializing the ObjectDetector class and calling the detect_objects method. If you need to train the model, use the train_model.py script with your dataset to define the paths for training data and labels, and specify parameters like epochs and batch size.
